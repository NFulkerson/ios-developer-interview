#  Hello

Welcome to the Pura Interview Process. 

We would like you to take this sample app and improve it in some way.

Please take 2-4 hours (no more than 4!) to plan and make your improvements. Once you are finished please submit a PR and reach out to Pura to set up your next interview. 

The next interview will be one hour and be prepared to talk about which improvements you made and why you made them.
